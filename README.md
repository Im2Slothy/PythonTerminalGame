# PythonTerminalGame
Pretty Basic Python customizable story game!

You can play by downloading the code which will come in a python file. All you have to do is click the file to open and the game will begin!

Follow the questions to start :) I hope you enjoy as it is my first python game! Out of context but my goal is to build a snake terminal game by the end of 2021!

I hope you enjoy!
